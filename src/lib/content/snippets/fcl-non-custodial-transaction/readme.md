		tempId: `${accountAddress}-${keyId}`, // tempIds are more of an advanced topic, for 99% of the times where you know the address and keyId you will want it to be a unique string per that address and keyId
		addr: sansPrefix(accountAddress), // the address of the signatory, currently it needs to be without a prefix right now
		keyId: Number(keyId), // this is the keyId for the accounts registered key that will be used to sign, make extra sure this is a number and not a string
