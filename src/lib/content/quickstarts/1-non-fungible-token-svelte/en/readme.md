## üö© Quickstart 1: NonFungibleToken

üé´ Deploy your own NFT contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template SvelteKit app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

üåü The final deliverable is a DApp that lets users mint and transfer some NFTs on Flow Testnet.

## üì¶ Checkpoint 0: Install

Required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
- [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/) - you know you have installed it if you type `flow version` in your terminal and it prints a version.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emerald-dao/1-non-fungible-token-svelte.git
```

First, rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`

Then, in a terminal window, install the dependencies and start your frontend:

```sh
cd 1-non-fungible-token-svelte
npm install
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal window, start your local emulator:

```bash
cd 1-non-fungible-token-svelte
flow emulator start -v
```

_Note: the `-v` flag means to print transaction and script output to your local emulator_

In a third terminal window, deploy your contract and start your local wallet:

```bash
cd 1-non-fungible-token-svelte
flow project deploy
flow dev-wallet
```

You can `flow project deploy --update` to deploy a new contract or update your existing `ExampleNFT` contract any time.

## üëõ Checkpoint 1: Wallets

We'll be using **the local Flow dev wallet**.

Click the "Connect" button and notice a window appears with different accounts to select, each with their own Flow Token balance. Select the first account to log in to it.

## üï≥Ô∏è Checkpoint 2: Set up your NFT Collection

After logging in to the account with address `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`, click the `Setup Collection` button:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/6JfueE9.png" alt="set up nft collection" />

This will store an empty NFT collection inside of your account's storage so you have the ability to receive NFTs.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Checkpoint 3: Minting NFTs

Now that we have set up your account, we can mint some NFTs to it.

In a terminal, run `npm run mint 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/LR5z0cL.png" alt="mint NFTs transaction" />

This will mint 3 NFTs to the supplied address (`0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`).

## üëÄ Checkpoint 4: See Your NFTs

Go back to your application and click `Get NFTs`. Notice that 3 NFTs appear! Woooohoooo.

## üìò Checkpoint 5: Setup Another User

Log out of the current account and connect to another account. Set up another NFT Collection.

## üíæ Checkpoint 6: Transfer an NFT

Log out of your account and go back to the first account that has the NFTs. After clicking "Get NFTs" again, go to one of the NFT boxes, copy and paste the address of the 2nd account you set up (ex. `0x045a1763c93006ca`) and click `Transfer`:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ehmS5ej.png" alt="transfer an NFT" />

This will transfer an NFT to the 2nd account. Log in to that account, click `Get NFTs`, and you will see it has an NFT now!

## üîê Checkpoint 7: Create a Testnet Account

Create a new account by opening up a terminal in the same directory as your project and typing `flow accounts create`. 
- Name: `testnet-account`
- Network: `Testnet`

Open up your flow.json file and you should see under the "accounts" object that it automatically configured a testnet-account for you.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure `testnet-account.pkey` is inside your .gitignore. You never want to commit private keys to git!

## üíæ Checkpoint 8: Deploy to Testnet!

We will now deploy our contracts to the account we just created.

In your flow.json file, under the "deployments" object, add the following:

```json
"testnet": {
  "testnet-account": [
    "ExampleNFT"
  ]
}
```

Then, under the "contracts" object, find the "ExampleNFT" object and add a new testnet alias. The address you put should be the same one that was added to your flow.json automatically under the "testnet-account" object:

```json
"ExampleNFT": {
  "source": "./src/lib/flow/cadence/contracts/ExampleNFT.cdc",
  "aliases": {
    "emulator": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
    "testnet": "5f4ea4877f5afeab"
  }
}
```

Your final flow.json should look something like this:

```json
{
	"contracts": {
		"FIND": {
			"source": "./src/flow/cadence/contracts/utility/FIND.cdc",

		}
	},
	"networks": {

	},
	"deployments": {

				"ExampleNFT"
			]
		},
		"testnet": {
			"testnet-account": [
				"ExampleNFT"
			]
		}
	}
}
```

üöÄ Deploy your ExampleNFT smart contract:

```sh
flow project deploy --network=testnet
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9rfZNhr.png" alt="deploy contract to testnet" />

In your .env file, change the following:

1. `PUBLIC_FLOW_NETWORK=testnet`
2. `PRIVATE_KEY` to the private key of the testnet account you created. It should be in the `testnet-account.pkey` file. **You must remove the `0x` from the beginning of the private key for it to work.**

You can now stop all your terminals since we no longer need to run our own local blockchain or wallet. Everything lives on testnet!

Run `npm run dev` to start your application in a terminal, and have a blast with your DApp!

## üìù Make Edits!

üîè You can also check out your smart contract `ExampleNFT.cdc` in `flow/cadence/ExampleNFT.cdc`.

üíº Take a quick look at how your contract get deployed in `flow.json`.

üìù If you want to make frontend edits, open `+page.svelte` in `src/routes/+page.svelte`.
