## üö© Quickstart 1: Non-Fungible Token

üé´ Deploy your own NFT contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Swift iOS/iPadOS app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

üåü The final deliverable is a Mobile DApp that lets users create an empty collection, mint some pre-loaded NFTs, and transfer them to another account on Flow testnet.

## üìπ Video Walkthrough

Coming Soon!...hopefully..

## üì¶ Checkpoint 0: Install

Required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/) (üß® Use Node v16 or a previous version as v17 may cause errors üß®). You know you have installed it if you type `node -v` in your terminal and it prints a version.
- [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/) (üß® Make sure to install the correct link for your system üß®). You know you have installed it if you type `flow version` in your terminal and it prints a version.

> in a terminal window, clone the project repo, install the dependencies, and open the project in Xcode:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/boiseitguru/1-non-fungible-token-ios.git
cd 1-non-fungible-token-ios
npm install
open NonFungible\ Token.xcodeproj
```

> Next we need to copy or rename `flow.json.example` to `flow.json`.

```sh
mv flow.json.example flow.json
```

> in a second terminal window, start your üë∑‚Äç local emulator:

```bash
cd 1-non-fungible-token-ios
flow emulator start -v
```

_Note: the `-v` flag means to print transaction and script output to your local emulator_

> in a third terminal window, üíæ deploy your contract and üí∏ start your local wallet:

```bash
cd 1-non-fungible-token-ios
flow project deploy
flow dev-wallet
```

> You can `flow project deploy --update` to deploy a new contract any time.

üì± Once the emulator and dev-wallet have been started, use Xcode to run your app on the iOS simulator. (üß® FCL-Swift does not currently support using the dev-wallet on a physical iOS device.)

## üëõ Checkpoint 1: Wallets

We'll be using **the local Flow dev wallet**.

> Click the "Log In" button and notice a pop up asking you to connect a wallet. Select `Dev Wallet` then wait for the authentication page to load. Notice a window appears with one or more accounts to select, each with their own Flow Token balance. Select the first account to log in to it.

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bbS1hknl.png" alt="account-select" />
</div>

---

## üëÄ Checkpoint 2: See your NFTs

> After logging in to the account with address `0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`, click the `Get NFTs` button. Notice that you get an error:

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FiSkeq1l.png" alt="get-nfts" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9jUuQJHl.png" alt="initial-error" />
</div>

The reason for this is because we haven't set up the user's account to be able to receive NFTs. On Flow, accounts needs to have a collection in their account to store specific NFTs. Let's set that up that now.

> Click the `Setup Collection` button, then approve the transaction:

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FiSkeq1l.png" alt="setup-account" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iGrohdpl.png" alt="approve-transaction" />
</div>

This will set up the user's account so it can receive NFTs.

> Try clicking `Get NFTs`. You will see no NFTs appear. So let's mint some NFTs!

---

## ‚úèÔ∏è Checkpoint 3: Minting the NFT‚Äôs

Now that we have set up the user's account, we can mint some NFTs to it.

> In a terminal, run `npm run mint 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/N2Twynw.png" alt="mint NFTs transaction" />

This will mint 3 NFTs to the supplied address (`0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`).

> Go back to your application and click `Get NFTs` again. Notice that a paged TabView with 3 NFTs appear! Woooohoooo.

<div class="md-images">

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Q3QnZNFl.png" alt="building-nft" />
</div>

---

## üìò Checkpoint 4: Setup empty user Collection

> Log out of the current account and begin the login process again, however, this time we will be creating a new account using the dev-wallet. After the account selection screen loads press the green "+" button next to the words "Create new Account", give the account a name, then click "CREATE". You can now select the newly created account to login with:

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/bbS1hknl.png" alt="account-select" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fb4hh6Vl.png" alt="create-account" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/5FilEbml.png" alt="account-created" />
</div>

> Click `Get NFTs` again. You will see an error appear:

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FiSkeq1l.png" alt="get-nfts" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/9jUuQJHl.png" alt="second-error" />
</div>

Again, this is because we haven't set up the user's account. We will do this again by clicking the `Setup Collection` button and approving the transaction:

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/FiSkeq1l.png" alt="setup-account" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/detzsD4l.png" alt="approve-transaction" />
</div>

This will set up the user's account so it can receive NFTs.

> Try clicking `Get NFTs`. You will see no NFTs appear. So let's transfer some from the other account!

---

## üíæ Checkpoint 5: Transfer an NFT

> üìî Log out of your account and go back to the Service Account. In one of the NFT boxes, copy and paste `0x179b6b1cb6755e31` and click `Transfer`:

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/yMJRfQnl.png" alt="transfer-nft" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/V3ptnErl.png" alt="approve-transaction" />
</div>

This will transfer an NFT to the `0x179b6b1cb6755e31` account.

Log in to that account, click `Get NFTs`, and you will see it has an NFT now!

<div class="md-images">
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/cnwV3Erl.png" alt="received-nft" />
</div>

## üíæ Checkpoint 6: Deploy it to testnet!

üìî Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> üîê Generate a **deployer address** by typing `flow keys generate --network=testnet` into a terminal. Make sure to save your public key and private key somewhere, you will need them soon.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Rf0f1ox.png" alt="generate key pair" />

> üëõ Create your **deployer account** by going to https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/, pasting in your public key from above, and clicking `CREATE ACCOUNT`:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/mkNCf1o.png" alt="configure testnet account on the website" width="400" />

> After it finishes, click `COPY ADDRESS` and make sure to save that address somewhere. You will need it!

> ‚õΩÔ∏è Add your new testnet account to your `flow.json` by modifying the following lines of code. Paste your address you copied above to where it says "YOUR GENERATED ADDRESS", and paste your private key where it says "YOUR PRIVATE KEY".

```json
{
	"emulators": {
		"default": {
			"port": 3569,
			"serviceAccount": "emulator-account"
		}
	},
	"contracts": {
		"NonFungibleToken": {
			"source": "./cadence/utility/NonFungibleToken.cdc",
			"aliases": {
				"testnet": "0x631e88ae7f1d7c20"
			}
		},
		"FungibleToken": {
			"source": "./cadence/utility/FungibleToken.cdc",
			"aliases": {
				"emulator": "0xee82856bf20e2aa6",
				"testnet": "0x9a0766d93b6608b7"
			}
		},
		"MetadataViews": {
			"source": "./cadence/utility/MetadataViews.cdc",
			"aliases": {
				"testnet": "0x631e88ae7f1d7c20"
			}
		},
		"ExampleNFT": "./cadence/ExampleNFT.cdc"
	},
	"networks": {
		"emulator": "127.0.0.1:3569",
		"mainnet": "access.mainnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000",
		"testnet": "access.devnet.nodes.onflow.org:9000"
	},
	"accounts": {
		"emulator-account": {
			"address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
			"key": "cdb3410ae829f5e2a29f71f53efbce66bde1187948d6317de6918d5003576ca7"
		}
	},
	"testnet-account": {
		"address": "YOUR GENERATED ADDRESS",
		"key": {
			"type": "hex",
			"index": 0,
			"signatureAlgorithm": "ECDSA_P256",
			"hashAlgorithm": "SHA3_256",
			"privateKey": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY"
		}
	},
	"deployments": {
		"emulator": {
			"emulator-account": ["NonFungibleToken", "MetadataViews", "ExampleNFT"]
		}
	},
	"testnet": {
		"testnet-account": ["ExampleNFT"]
	}
}
```

Notice that we do not want to re-deploy NonFungibleToken or MetadataViews. That is because they are already deploy and live on Flow testnet!

> üöÄ Deploy your ExampleNFT smart contract:

```sh
flow project deploy --network=testnet
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9rfZNhr.png" alt="deploy contract to testnet" />

üì± Open `NonFungible Token.xcodeproj` in Xcode and update line 13 of `Hello World > Flow > FlowManager.swift with the newly created Testnet account so we can interact with your new contract.

```swift
import UIKit

let testAccount = "YOUR TESTNET ACCOUNT"

class FlowManager: ObservableObject {
  ...
}
```

You will also need to change the first to lines of the `setup()` function inside FlowManager to switch over to the Flow testnet, as shown below. WalletConnect has been configured for this project allowing you to use the wallet of your choice on testnet. For details on how to setup Lilico Wallet for development use on testnet, check out our course [Setting Up Lilico Wallet For Development](https://academy.ecdao.org/en/catalog/courses/setting-up-lilico-wallet-for-development)

```swift
class FlowManager: ObservableObject {
  ...
  func setup() {
      let defaultProvider: FCL.Provider = .blocto
      let defaultNetwork: Flow.ChainID = .testnet
      ...
  }
  ...
}
```

Lastly, run the app in the simulator or on your iOS/iPadOS Device.

## üìù Make Edits!

üîè You can also check out your smart contract `ExampleNFT.cdc` in `flow/cadence/ExampleNFT.cdc`.

üíº Take a quick look at how your contract get deployed in `flow.json`.

üìù The app is written in SwiftUI, and implements a "No View Model" design. With the exception of the FlowManager service and a few UI helpers in the Misc directory, the design and direct functions can all be modified in the Views directory.
