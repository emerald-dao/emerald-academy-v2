## 🚩 Quickstart 2: Fungible Token

🎫 Deploy a FungibleToken contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain and Cadence. You'll use:

- The local Flow emulator to deploy smart contracts.
- The local Flow dev wallet to log into test accounts.
- A template Next.js app with sample scripts and transactions to interact with your contract.

🌟 The final deliverable is a DApp that lets users create their own fungible token and transfer them to another account on Flow testnet.

## 📦 Checkpoint 0: Install

Required:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v16.x/) (🧨 Use Node v16 or a previous version as v17 may cause errors 🧨). You know you have installed it if you type `node -v` in your terminal and it prints a version.
- [Flow CLI](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli/install/) (🧨 Make sure to install the correct link for your system 🧨). You know you have installed it if you type `flow version` in your terminal and it prints a version.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/emerald-dao/2-fungible-token.git
```

> in a terminal window, 📱 install the dependencies start your frontend:

```sh
cd 2-fungible-token
npm install
npm run dev
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 👷‍ local emulator:

```bash
cd 2-fungible-token
flow emulator start -v
```

_Note: the `-v` flag means to print transaction and script output to your local emulator_

> in a third terminal window, 💾 deploy your contract and 💸 start your local wallet:

```bash
cd 2-fungible-token
flow project deploy
flow dev-wallet
```

> You can `flow project deploy --update` to deploy a new contract any time.

📱 Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

## 👛 Checkpoint 1: Wallets

We'll be using **the local Flow dev wallet**.

> Click the "Log In" button and notice a window appears with different accounts to select, each with their own Flow Token balance. Select the first account to log in to it.

## 📘 Checkpoint 2: Reading Your Balance

> When you log in, click the little spinner next to your balance in the top right. Notice that you get an error:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IIXjt8h.png" alt="error when getting balance" width="400" />

The reason for this is because we haven't set up a vault in the user's account. On Flow, you need a vault in your account to be able to store specific tokens. Let's set that up that now.

> Click the `Setup Vault` button:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4XEwntp.png" alt="setup vault for user account" width="400" />

This will set up the user's account so it can receive tokens.

> Try refreshing the balance again. You will see a balance of 0.0. So let's mint some tokens!

## ✏️ Checkpoint 3: Minting Fungible Tokens

> In a terminal, run `npm run mint 0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7 30.0`.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hTEzmqe.png" alt="mint fungible tokens" />

This will mint 30 tokens to their address (`0xf8d6e0586b0a20c7`).

> Go back to your application and refresh the balance again. Notice that you have a balance of 30.0 now! Woooohoooo.

## 📘 Checkpoint 4: Setup Second User Vault

We want to transfer tokens to another account, but the problem is we don't have another account (that is set up properly) to transfer tokens to!

> Log out of the current account and login to another account. Refresh the balance again. You will see an error appear:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/hmS1eYZ.png" alt="error when getting tokens" width="400" />

Again, this is because we haven't set up the user's account. We will do this again by clicking the `Setup Vault` button:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4XEwntp.png" alt="setup vault for user account" width="400" />

This will set up the user's account so it can receive tokens.

> Try refreshing the balance again. You will see a balance of 0.0. So let's transfer some from the other account!

## 💾 Checkpoint 5: Transfer Tokens

> 📔 Log out of your account and go back to the Service Account. In the main box, put `0x179b6b1cb6755e31` as the recipient and `10.0` as the amount, then click `Transfer Tokens`:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/guxcLRz.png" alt="transfer tokens" />

This will transfer tokens to the `0x179b6b1cb6755e31` account. Log in to that account, refresh the balance, and you will see you have 10.0 tokens now!

## 💾 Checkpoint 6: Deploy it to testnet!

📔 Ready to deploy to a public testnet?!?

> 🔐 Generate a **deployer address** by typing `flow keys generate --network=testnet` into a terminal. Make sure to save your public key and private key somewhere, you will need them soon.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/jU9sRiL.png" alt="generate key pair" />

> 👛 Create your **deployer account** by going to https://testnet-faucet.onflow.org/, pasting in your public key from above, and clicking `CREATE ACCOUNT`:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OitvEoO.png" alt="configure testnet account on the website" width="400" />

> After it finishes, click `COPY ADDRESS` and make sure to save that address somewhere. You will need it!

> ⛽️ Add your new testnet account to your `flow.json` by modifying the following lines of code. Paste your address you copied above to where it says "YOUR GENERATED ADDRESS", and paste your private key where it says "YOUR PRIVATE KEY".

```json
{
"accounts": {
  "emulator-account": {
    "address": "f8d6e0586b0a20c7",
    "key": "5112883de06b9576af62b9aafa7ead685fb7fb46c495039b1a83649d61bff97c"
  },
  "testnet-account": {
    "address": "YOUR GENERATED ADDRESS",
    "key": {
      "type": "hex",
      "index": 0,
      "signatureAlgorithm": "ECDSA_P256",
      "hashAlgorithm": "SHA3_256",
      "privateKey": "YOUR PRIVATE KEY"
    }
  }
},
"deployments": {
  "emulator": {
    "emulator-account": [
			"ExampleToken"
		]
  },
  "testnet": {
    "testnet-account": [
      "ExampleToken"
    ]
  }
}
}
```

> 🚀 Deploy your ExampleToken smart contract:

```sh
flow project deploy --network=testnet
```

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/iTqfXeg.png" alt="deploy contract to testnet" />

> Lastly, configure your .env file to point to Flow TestNet so we can interact with your new contract.

In your .env file, change the following:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` to your generated testnet address
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_STANDARD_ADDRESS` to `0x9a0766d93b6608b7`
3. `PRIVATE_KEY` to your private key
4. `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACCESS_NODE` to `https://rest-testnet.onflow.org`
5. `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET` to `https://fcl-discovery.onflow.org/testnet/authn`

You can now terminate all your terminals since we no longer need to run our own local blockchain or wallet. Everything lives on testnet!

Let's try out our DApp on testnet:

1. Run `npm run dev` to start your application in a terminal.
2. On http://localhost:3000/, click "connect" and log in to your Blocto or Lilico wallet, making sure to copy the address you log in with.
3. Click "Setup Vault" to give yourself a vault and the ability to store tokens
4. In a terminal, run `npm run mint [THE ADDRESS OF THE ACCOUNT YOU'RE LOGGED IN TO] [AMOUNT OF TOKENS]`
5. In your terminal, you should see a printed "Transaction Id". If you go to [Testnet Flowdiver](https://testnet.flowdiver.io) and paste in that Transaction Id, you should see information about that minting transaction.
6. Refresh the balance once again, and you should see tokens minted to your account :)

## 📝 Make Edits!

🔏 You can also check out your smart contract `ExampleToken.cdc` in `flow/cadence/ExampleToken.cdc`.

💼 Take a quick look at how your contract get deployed in `flow.json`.

📝 If you want to make frontend edits, open `index.js` in `pages/index.js`.
