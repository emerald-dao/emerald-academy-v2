## üö© Quickstart 0: Hello Flow UnitySDK

Learn to deploy a simple Greetings contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain, Cadence and Flow Unity SDK. We‚Äôll use:
- Flow CLI (Testnet)
- Unity
- Flow Unity SDK
- Editor of your choice (VS Code is preffered)

We will be making a Unity project that will allow us to create a new greeting, modify it and display it.

## üì¶ Checkpoint 0: Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/memxor/FlowGreetingsUnity.git
```

Next, open the project using Unity (recommended 2022.3.8f1) and run the project by clicking the play button in the Unity editor.

## üëõ Checkpoint 1: Log In

In order to log in with a wallet, you will have to scan the QR code.

## üìò Checkpoint 2: Reading the Greeting

Next, lets read the greeting that is currently on Flow testnet. To do this, click the "Read Greeting" button.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Checkpoint 3: Changing the Greeting

Now lets run a transaction which will modify the data in our smart contract. In order to do this, input a new greeting where it says "Enter a New Greeting" and click "Submit". This will initialize a transaction that will take a few seconds.

## üìò Checkpoint 4: Reading the Updated Greeting

Now that we have updated our greeting, click the "Read Greeting" button again and confirm that the greeting has actually been changed.
