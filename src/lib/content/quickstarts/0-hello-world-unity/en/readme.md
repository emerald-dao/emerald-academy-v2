## 🚩 Quickstart 0: Hello Flow UnitySDK

Learn to deploy a simple Greetings contract to learn the basics of the Flow blockchain, Cadence and Flow Unity SDK. We’ll use:
- Flow CLI (Testnet)
- Unity
- Flow Unity SDK
- Editor of your choice (VS Code is preffered)

We will be making an Unity Project that will allow us to Create a new Greeting, Modify it and Display it.
